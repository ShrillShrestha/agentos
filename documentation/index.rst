AgentOS: a learning agent platform
==================================

AgentOS is an open source **Python API and a command line interface** for
building, running, and sharing learning agents. AgentOS is licensed under the
Apache License, Version 2.0.

Key features include:
  * Easy to use Agent API for developing and running new agents.

  * Example learning agents from different disciplines and research areas are
    available in the
    `example_agents
    <https://github.com/agentos-project/agentos/tree/master/example_agents>`_
    directory of the project source code.

  * Reuse of OpenAI's Gym Environment abstraction.

AgentOS is experimental beta software, as indicated by the major and minor
version numbers being zero (e.g., 0.0.x). This means APIs and overall
architecture are not stable and likely to change significantly over time.

Find the `AgentOS sourcecode on Github
<https://github.com/agentos-project/agentos>`_.
