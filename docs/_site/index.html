        <div class="home"><p>AgentOS is a <strong>command line interface and python developer API</strong> for building, running, and sharing flexible learning agents.</p>

<p>AgentOS proposes a standard minimal architecture for a learning agent, and includes an API and example agent implementations for developers. The benefits of common general agent related abstractions include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It is easier and faster to build agents since creators can focus on what is important to them without having to rewrite the parts that are less interesting but necessary in all agents (e.g., code to manage long running processes, parallelism, etc.).</li>
  <li>A simple open standard makes it easier to talk about agents, share agent code, and quickly understand agents created by others. These benefits are similar to those of the OpenAI Gym standard API for agent environments (gym.Env).</li>
</ul>

<p>The best way to understand AgentOS is to use it, so let’s write a simple agent in python that behaves randomly:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># Save this code in ./simple_agent.py
from agentos import Agent

class SimpleAgent(Agent):
    def advance(self):
        obs, reward, done, _ = self.env.step(self.env.action_space.sample())
        print(f"Took a random step, done = {done}.")
        return done
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That’s it. Only one function is required to create an agent: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">advance()</code>. It takes no arguments, has access to the agent’s environment, and returns a boolean indicating if the agent is done.</p>

<p>Next let’s make an instance of our agent, pass its constructor an environment (or env) class that the agent will interact with, and have the agent advance (i.e., take one step of action) in that environment.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ pip install agentos gym

$ python
&gt;&gt;&gt; from simple_agent import SimpleAgent
&gt;&gt;&gt; from gym.envs.classic_control import CartPoleEnv
&gt;&gt;&gt; agent = SimpleAgent(CartPoleEnv)
&gt;&gt;&gt; agent.advance()
Took a random step, done = False.
False
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The return value of False indicates that the agent is not yet “done”. Notice that in this code we are using an OpenAI gym environment (more about that below).</p>

<p>Let’s continue running our agent using a while loop until it is done:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; done = False
&gt;&gt;&gt; while not done:
&gt;&gt;&gt;     done = agent.step()
Took a random step, done = False.
…
Took a random step, done = False.
Took a random step, done = True.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The number of steps that the agent takes before being done is random since its behavior is random (also the environment has randomness in it).</p>

<p>Now, instead of writing our own while loop, let’s run the agent in a python Thread using a convenience function that AgentOS provides which serves as an Agent Runner:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; agentos.run_agent(SimpleAgent, CartPoleEnv)
Took a random step, done = False.
…
Took a random step, done = False.
Took a random step, done = True.

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Or we can run the agent via the AgentOS CLI (run the following back in your shell):</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ agentos run simple_agent.py gym.envs.classic_control.CartPoleEnv
Took a random step, done = False.
…
Took a random step, done = False.
Took a random step, done = True.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To make things easier, AgentOS includes implementations of some common agents. As an alternative to using our custom agent above, let’s use AgentOS’s RandomAgent:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ python
&gt;&gt;&gt; from agentos.agents import RandomAgent
&gt;&gt;&gt; from gym.envs.classic_control import CartPoleEnv
&gt;&gt;&gt; agentos.run_agent(RandomAgent, CartPoleEnv)
Took a random step, done = False.
…
Took a random step, done = False.
Took a random step, done = True.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we have created and run an agent, but what is an agent? Colloquially speaking, it is an entity that can do things in its environment. In the context of computer science, an agent is a running “thread” of execution (here we mean the concept of a thread; the actual implementation might be a process, threadVM, etc.). Both of those descriptions are true of AgentOS agents as well.</p>

<p>Let’s focus on the first one: agents interact with Environments. In our examples above, the agent is interacting with an instance of a simple physics simulator environment provided by OpenAI Gym called <a href="https://github.com/openai/gym/blob/master/gym/envs/classic_control/cartpole.py">CartPole</a> (if you’re not familiar with gym, learn more about it <a href="https://gym.openai.com/">here</a>). In this environment, or world, the agent is trying to balance a pole on a cart by nudging the cart to the left or right. Because we made her a RandomAgent, she is flipping a fair coin at each timestep to decide which way to nudge the cart. For more on agents and environments, see the section below containing background on Reinforcement Learning. (TODO: We can use our agentOS’s web UI to see her status and watch her behaving in the world we set up for her.)</p>

<p>We have essentially created a simplistic being with some virtual sensors and motors, and given her the ability to use them to interact with her world, making observations and taking random actions in it. That’s an accomplishment, but note that she’s not learning anything as she goes, nor behaving very wisely. Still, you can start to get a sense of how to compose an agent with AgentOS.</p>

<p>In this simple example, you have interacted with some of AgentOS’s core abstractions:
Environment - A stateful model of the world with a simple API. Used by an agent to make observations and take actions.
Agent - Encapsulates a decision-making process (and memory) that uses observations to decide what actions to take, which obviously can impact what observations will come next. An agent is also responsible for learning, i.e., improving itself over time through experience, e.g., through RL algorithms.
Agent Runner - an abstraction responsible for running an agent with a given environment.</p>

<p>If you’re familiar with reinforcement learning (RL), both the environment and agent concepts are the same in AgentOS as in RL.</p>

<p>Here is a diagram showing the main AgentOS architectural components, including those listed above:</p>
